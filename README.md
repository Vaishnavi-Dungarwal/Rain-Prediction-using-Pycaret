Rain Prediction Web App using PyCaret

This project aims to create a web application that predicts whether it will rain tomorrow or not. We will leverage various machine learning models and the powerful AutoML library PyCaret to build and compare predictive models for accurate rain forecasting.

Time Line of the Project
Data Analysis: We will start by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset. EDA will help us understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and gain insights into the features that influence rain prediction.

Handling Missing Values: It is common to encounter missing values in real-world datasets. We will address this issue through appropriate imputation techniques to ensure our models have complete data to learn from.

Handling Categorical Variables: Machine learning models typically require numerical data, but our dataset may contain categorical variables. We will apply suitable encoding or one-hot encoding techniques to transform them into a numerical format.

Feature Engineering: Feature engineering plays a crucial role in improving model performance. We will create new relevant features and apply transformations to the existing ones to extract valuable information for rain prediction.

Model Building using ML: We will train various machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, to predict rain tomorrow. These models will be evaluated using appropriate metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

Model Building using Auto ML (PyCaret): In this step, we will harness the power of PyCaret, an AutoML library, to automate the model selection and tuning process. PyCaret will efficiently evaluate multiple models and provide us with the best-performing model for rain prediction.
